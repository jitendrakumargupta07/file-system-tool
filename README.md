File System Recovery and Optimization Tool

# File System Recovery and Optimization Tool

## Description
This project implements a **File System Recovery and Optimization Tool** that helps in recovering lost data and optimizing file system performance. It provides functionalities like free-space management, directory structures, file access mechanisms, and more. The tool also simulates real-world scenarios like disk crashes and offers recovery techniques while optimizing file read/write times.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jitendrakumargupta07/file-system-tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd file-system-tool
    ```

3. Install required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, along with any additional dependencies.

## Usage

1. Run the tool by executing the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. The tool provides the following features:
    - **File Creation and Deletion**: Create and delete files on the simulated file system.
    - **Free Space Management**: Monitor free space and optimize storage.
    - **File Recovery**: Simulate disk crashes and attempt to recover lost files.
    - **File Read/Write Optimization**: Optimize the read/write speeds by adjusting algorithms.

3. The UI allows interaction with these features through buttons and forms.

## Features
- **Free-Space Management**: Track and manage free space on the disk.
- **Directory Structures**: Handle directory structures to organize files effectively.
- **File Access Mechanisms**: Implement efficient file access methods.
- **Disk Crash Simulation**: Simulate disk crashes and recover files.
- **File Read/Write Optimization**: Improve the speed and efficiency of file operations.
